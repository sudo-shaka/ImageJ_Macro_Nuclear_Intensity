# ImageJ_Macro_Nuclear_Intensity

The macro will take a 3 channel .OIR file and automate calculating nuclear expression intensity from confocal microscopy. It will also save a merged jpg as well as single channel Jpegs. 

The python script, Rscript, and C++ code will take the exported data from the macro and put it into a CSV file and can calculate the percentage of cells above a certain threshhold
